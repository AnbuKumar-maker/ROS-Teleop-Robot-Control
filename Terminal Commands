Step 1: To install rosserial on ROS Melodic, type the below command
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosserial

First, create a new folder in your ROS workspace and name it rosseiral_ws for example.

Create another folder inside named src

mkdir -p ~/rosserial_ws/src

Move to your src folder

cd ~/rosserial_ws/src

Step 2: Clone the source code in this directory

git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git

When the clone is complete, we need to build the package in the workspace. Go back to the main folder

cd ~/rosserial_ws

Then type this command. It will build the package creating build and devel folders

catkin_make

Step 3: To introduce the installed package to ROS, use the following

source ~/rosserial_ws/devel/setup.bash

Step 4 : Now you need to install Teleop by typing below command

sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-teleop-twist-keyboard


Step 5: Now you need to upload the DC Motor Control Arduino Code to Arduino


Step 6:  To run the code, open cmd window and type (DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL)

roscore

Step 7: To run rosserial client that passes the messages from Arduino to ROS (DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL)

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0


Step 8: Now open the Teleop package from the terminal using the below command (DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL)


rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
